Configuration can be done in-game via the `vea-config` command or by editing `vanilla_enchant_additions.conf` in the world save folder.</br>
`/vea-config get [optional setting argument]` - gets the value of a setting, or all settings if not provided. Usable by all players by default.</br>
`/vea-config set [setting] [value]` - sets the value of a setting and updates the file. Fails if value type does not match.</br>
`/vea-config reload` - reloads settings if file was directly edited
